# Roadmap 2018

- Finish the tenancy/tenancy package with all necessary contracts and bare logic.
- Create tenant identification drivers that replicate the logic of the predecessor (eg hostname based identification).
- Create mysql (including mariadb) and postgres database drivers.
- Enforce a code coverage of at least 90%.
